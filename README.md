Initial page says Welcome, (name). Fades away to the Watch Tower Page (Central Page)
To the Left of the Watch Tower page is the Hindsight HUD and to the right is the Foresight HUD
You access these by putting your cursor on either the Left or right 1/16, half way of the hieght of the page. 
You are shown a preview of the page in a smaller version. and if you click you access it.
Hindsight - Watch Tower - Foresight
Watch tower will have one quote about hindsight and one quote about foresight
underneath that you will find ur fico credit score and other indications about your current financial health. 

Ideads about grading financial health. Overlay a Green plus sign or a Red minus sign to show whether this bank or association is benefiting or hurting you right now. you can press on it to inspect more. This inspection will show the particular parts of the account. Like if its a bank it will show ur checking account, savings, loan and net amount. Maybe also a hopeful financial quote by like Robert T K

We need to ask ourselves what does the GEO tracker do other than looks very cool.

Design wise I want to give the subtle feeling that you are in some kinda of Justice League Spaceship and there are three monitors infront of you. You are commanding this HUD to give oyu information about the current dituation of your finances. This app is not to teach people. This app is to allow people to make their own educated decisions.
