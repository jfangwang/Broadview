In a world of information, knowledge is scattered. Our objective is to organize the lives of our users to give them the data to better traverse their future.

Broadview is an application that grants users a detailed look into the past and future of their financial timeline and shows the health of their accounts.

“Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.”
                                                  - Soren Kierkegaard
                                                  
<sub>Disclosure: Centralizing ones finances has the benefit of getting the big picture, but, to avoid the dangers of centralization, Broadview does not allow for any manipulation of ones finances.
